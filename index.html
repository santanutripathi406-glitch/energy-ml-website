<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
Power transformer failures in rural distribution systems lead to frequent outages, high maintenance costs, and reduced reliability of electricity supply. 
This project proposes a lightweight and energy-efficient machine learning model designed to predict transformer failure risk using operational parameters such as temperature, load percentage, and voltage fluctuation. 

The proposed approach focuses on computational efficiency so that prediction can be performed with minimal hardware requirements, making it suitable for rural deployment. 
The system enables early warning detection, allowing preventive maintenance and improved power distribution reliability.

<section id="dataset">
<h2>Dataset Description</h2>
<p>
The dataset used in this study consists of operational parameters collected from distribution transformers. 
Key features include temperature readings, load percentage, voltage fluctuation levels, and historical failure records.

Data preprocessing involved normalization, removal of inconsistent values, and feature selection to ensure efficient model training. 
The dataset represents real-world operating conditions in rural power systems, enabling accurate risk prediction.

<section id="architecture">
<h2>Model Architecture</h2>
<p>
The prediction system uses a lightweight supervised machine learning model optimized for low computational cost. 
Selected features are processed through a classification model that categorizes transformer status into low-risk, medium-risk, or high-risk failure probability.

The model emphasizes simplicity and efficiency, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments while maintaining reliable prediction capability.
